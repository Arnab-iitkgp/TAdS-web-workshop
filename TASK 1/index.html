Holi, the festival of colors, marks the arrival of spring and the triumph of good over evil. It's a time when people come together to celebrate with enthusiasm and exuberance.

            As we gather to play with colors, let's also embrace the deeper significance of Holi. It's a time to forgive and forget, to let go of grudges and start anew. Let the vibrant colors wash away all negativity and fill our hearts with love and positivity.</h3>
